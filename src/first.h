/*
	Stores all procedures related to computing
	the FIRST operation for a grammar symbol.

	Let a be a string of grammar symbols,
	then FIRST(a) is the set of terminals
	that begin the strings derived from a.

	Here's the rules for computing FIRST:

	1. If X is a single terminal FIRST(X) = {X}.

	2. If X -> e (empty) is a production, then
	add e to FIRST(X).

	3. If X is a nonterminal with a production
	X -> Y_1 Y_2 ... Y_k, then put a in FIRST(X)
	if for some i, a is in FIRST(Y_i) and e is in
	all of FIRST(Y_1), ..., FIRST(Y_(i-1)).
	If e is in FIRST(Y_j) for j = 1 ... k, add e
	to FIRST(X).

	Using these rules, you can compute the FIRST
	for a string of symbols Q = X_1 X_2 ... X_n as follows:
	Add all non-e symbols of FIRST(X_1) to FIRST(Q). Add
	all non-e symbols of FIRST(X_k) if e is in FIRST(X_1), ..., FIRST(X_(k-1)).
	Add e to FIRST(Q) if e is in all FIRST(X_i) (for i in 1 .. n).
